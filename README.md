# Neural Network Classifier with Two Hidden Layers
This project is from the CoE 4SL3 Fundamentals of Machine Learning course

In this assignment, three neural network classifiers with two hidden layers for binary classification has been built: one making the prediction based on the first two features, another one predicting based on the first three features and lastly, a classifier based on four features. The data used for this assignment is the banknote authentication data set. There is a total of four features with 1372 examples, each example representing a banknote
